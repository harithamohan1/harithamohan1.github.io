Using data from the openaq database, I analyzed air pollution trends between the years 2018 to 2020 in the US and even analyzed data from Mumbai, India to compare. We created Tableau dashboards that included map animations and graphs to display the levels of particulate matter and ozone throughout various areas and how events such as wildfires and the COVID-19 pandemic have affected the air quality.
