An app designed to introduce students to programming in a beginner-friendly fashion. Learning a new programming language can often be daunting for beginners- new syntax rules, working in a new environment, the list goes on. Using layers of abstraction, students are introduced to the idea of programming through a declarative paradigm.

<!-- Using Python and the Google CoLab Jupyter Notebook, we created an interface that works very similarly to how an actual REPL would (hence the name Homework REPL). Users can choose from a plethora of key commands and pass in customized arguments in a declarative paradigm. Using regular expressions, the program parses through the userâ€™s input to identify what operation the user wants to perform as well as the measurements passed in. Helper functions are then called to perform the actual computation and the result is displayed back to the user. -->
